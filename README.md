# JS Tic-Tac-Toe

#### What is this?

A simple tic-tac-toe project made in javascript, html, and css. Based on the example provided [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-tic-tac-toe-game-using-javascript/).

#### Why?

A project for learning basic javascript. Changes from the linked example will mostly be applying things I've learned from learning python as a way of understanding the differences between the two languages and trying to practice some basic javascript.

#### What am I trying to do?

- use arrays for elements and ids
- break functions down into smaller, more specific, but reusable functions
- have input elements use the same generic move function by passing their own ids
